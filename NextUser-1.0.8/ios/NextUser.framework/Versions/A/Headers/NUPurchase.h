/**
 *  This class represents a general purchase. When user makes a purchase inside your application and
 *  you need to track that, use this class.
 *
 *  Each purchase has 2 parts at minimum: total amount and items being purchased. Purchase can be optionally
 *  supplemented with additional details (NUPurchaseDetails).
 *
 *  *Note: User of this class should not depend on purchase object to calculate total amount based on the item's
 *  price and quantity. Also, total amount value is not being calculated internally based on the purchase details
 *  (e.g. tax, shipping). It is totally up to the user of this class to pre calculate all values needed.*
